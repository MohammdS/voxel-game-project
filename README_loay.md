# voxel-game-project
A voxel based game with godot for a university project 
========================================================================================================================================
commit 1:
spent the time getting to know the environment since I never tried godot or any game development environment, 
so I downloaded godot, set up the environemnt, connected the project to github, made the first blocks in the game, made branches and learn how to merge branches,
and we are ready now to the minecarft tutorial in youtube, the plan for now is each one following the tutorial and get to know the environment in his own branch.

commit 2:
made basic minecraft game
in this commit I went throw a tutorial of making a basic minecraft game, it was challenging for me because its all new things, things that I never worked on in my life, so what i did is:
1: imported block system from a website given by the tutorial
2: made a simple map, basically an island with water on the sides and a bit of blocks in the middle making an island with simple design containing a tree and my name
3:made a player that can move in the map, look around and jump
4:added a raycast to the player camera to enable destroying, placing blocks
5: added basic destroying, placing block

# voxel-game-project
A voxel based game with godot for a university project 
========================================================================================================================================
spent the time getting to know the environment since I never tried godot or any game development environment, 
so I downloaded godot, set up the environemnt, connected the project to github, made the first blocks in the game, made branches and learn how to merge branches,
and we are ready now to the minecarft tutorial in youtube, the plan for now is each one following the tutorial and get to know the environment in his own branch.

# voxel-game-project
A voxel based game with godot for a university project (Mohammd Progress)
===============================================================================================================================================
This was our first session starting to work on our project which is a voxel based game (Minecraft like) using Godot game engine,
We discussed a lot of ideas of the main idea that our game will be out but we settled to nothing so we decided to leave that for later and started setting our work environment.
We downloaded Godot engine I watched a tutorial that explain some of the basics functions and buttons then we  initialized a GitHub respiratory and 
connected it to a main project that will be working on, each one of us made a branch and started experimenting with objects in the engine we figured(hardly) out how to make merging to main branch possible we finally synced everything together and made sure we have a working environment we can save and keep track of our work with.
we decided now make a some primal prototype of minecraft to learn more about the engine.

total time ~ 8hours
